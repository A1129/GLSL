Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 4.50
    (#version 450) and higher.

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES ESSL versions 3.20
    (#version 320) and higher.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language
    Specification, version 4.60, dated July 23, 2017.

    Interacts with GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl.

    Interacts with GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64 and
    GL_EXT_shader_explicit_arithmetic_types_int64.

Overview

    This extension allows storage block names to be declared with
    a "buffer_reference" layout, which lets them act as reference type names
    and be used to declare references within another block declaration, or as
    variables.
    
    A corresponding API extension provides functionality to retrieve the
    address value for a given buffer, and also defines the size and alignment
    of the reference types.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    None.

Modifications to GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl

    Add to the "Mapping to SPIR-V" section

    Uses the SPV_EXT_physical_storage_buffer extension to define reference
    types as pointer types to the PhysicalStorageBufferEXT storage class.

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

        #extension GL_EXT_buffer_reference : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3

    New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

        #define GL_EXT_buffer_reference     1

    Modify section 4.3.9 (Interface Blocks)

    Add to the end of the section:

      Shader storage blocks can be declared with the "buffer_reference" layout
      qualifier, which alters their behavior to create a type that is a
      reference to the block (as if the block were a structure type). The
      reference type's name is the block name. If there is no instance name,
      then no block variable is declared. If there is an instance name, then
      a block variable is declared and that variable behaves the same as if
      "buffer_reference" were not used. Set and binding layouts as well as
      qualifiers like coherent and volatile don't apply to the reference
      type, but do apply to the instance variable.

      The reference type can be used to declare block references in any
      storage type, including as block members, local variables, and function
      parameters and return types. When a reference type is used as a buffer
      or uniform block member, it is treated as an eight byte scalar type
      for the purposes of the block layout rules.

      The field selector ( . ) operator is used to access members through a
      reference.

      Additionally, the "buffer_reference" layout qualifier can be used to
      define a forward declaration to the reference type, so it can be used
      in other block declarations or in its own block declaration. A forward
      declaration is made by omitting the member list and instance name.

      If any access through a buffer reference value uses an address that is
      not within the bounds of a buffer, it produces undefined behavior.

      Each buffer reference type has an alignment that can be specified via
      the "buffer_reference_align" layout qualifier. This must be a power of
      two and be greater than or equal to the largest scalar/component type
      in the block. If the layout qualifier is not specified, it defaults to
      16 bytes. All buffer reference addresses used for a particular buffer
      reference type are assumed to be aligned to this alignment value. That
      is, the base of the block must be aligned, and members of the block can
      be aligned within the block using standard layouts and offset layout
      qualifiers.

      Example:

        // forward declaration
        layout(buffer_reference) buffer blockType;

        // complete reference type definition
        layout(buffer_reference, std430, buffer_reference_align = 16) buffer blockType {
            int x;
            blockType next;
        };

        // A normal block declaration that includes a reference to blockType
        layout(std430) buffer rootBlock {
            blockType root;
        } r;

        void main()
        {
            blockType b = r.root;
            // "pointer chasing" through a linked list
            b = b.next.next.next.next.next;
            // ...
            // use b.x;
        }


    Modify section 4.4 (Layout Qualifiers):

    Update the table to add a row for "buffer_reference":

      Layout Qualifier    Qualifier Only    Individual Variable    Block    Block Member    Allowed Interfaces
       buffer_reference          X                                   X                            buffer
    buffer_reference_align       X                                   X                            buffer

    Modify section 4.4.5 (Uniform and Shader Storage Block Layout Qualifiers):

    Add "buffer_reference" and "buffer_reference_align = integer-constant-expression"
    to the layout-qualifier-id grammar rule.

    Modify section 5.4.1 (Conversion and Scalar Constructors)

    Add to the end of the section:

      Buffer reference types can be constructed from other buffer reference
      types. Buffer reference types can be constructed from a single uint64_t
      value, and a uint64_t value can be constructed from a buffer reference
      type value.

Errors

    None.

Interactions with GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64 and
GL_EXT_shader_explicit_arithmetic_types_int64

    If neither GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64 nor
    GL_EXT_shader_explicit_arithmetic_types_int64 is supported, then remove
    the constructors to convert to and from uint64_t.

Interactions with GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl

    If GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl isn't supported, remove mention of descriptor set
    decorations.

Issues

    (1) Why "references" and not pointers?

    RESOLVED: Extending the block syntax to allow the types to be used
    similarly to C++ references is a small incremental change to the language
    and grammar, and provides most of the same functionality.

    (2) Should we provide a way to compare a reference to "null"?

    RESOLVED: No. Shaders can convert to uint64_t and compare the value
    against the NULL value specified by the API (zero, for Vulkan).
